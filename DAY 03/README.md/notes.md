# üö¢ 30 Days of Data Challenge - Day 3: Titanic Survival Analysis ‚öì

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project is a detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the historical **Titanic passenger manifest**, completed as part of the 30-Days of Data Challenge.

The primary goal was to move beyond simple counts and create an **interactive dashboard** in **Power BI** to analyze the demographics and uncover the key statistical factors influencing survival.

## üéØ Key Questions & Insights

The analysis focused on revealing the following insights through visualization:

* **Survival by Class:** What was the **survival probability** for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class passengers? (A measure of socio-economic impact.)
* **Gender Bias:** What was the massive **difference in survival rates** between male and female passengers?
* **Age Profile:** Did children and the elderly have different **survival chances** compared to the general population?
* **Fare vs. Survival:** Was there a direct **correlation** between the ticket price a passenger paid and their final outcome?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

| Tool | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Power BI Desktop** | Primary tool for **Visualization**, Dashboard Creation, and Data Modeling. |
| **Power Query (M)** | Used for **Data cleaning**, transformation, and handling of missing values (e.g., Age imputation). |
| **DAX** | Utilized for creating explicit **measures** and calculating key performance indicators (KPIs). |
| **Source Data** | `titanic_dataset.csv` |

## üìä Dashboard Summary

The final Power BI dashboard provides a clear, interactive data narrative:

1.  **Survival Rate by Class:** A **clear visualization** showing the dramatic difference in survival rates across the three classes.
2.  **Age Distribution Analysis:** **Histograms** comparing the age of survivors vs. non-survivors.
3.  **Passenger Metrics:** **KPI cards** displaying total passengers, overall survival rate, and passenger counts by embarkation port.
