🚢 30 Days of Data Challenge - Day 3: Titanic Survival Analysis
Project Overview 📝
This project is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the historical Titanic passenger manifest, completed as part of the 30-Days of Data Challenge.
The primary goal was to move beyond simple counts and create an interactive dashboard in Power BI to analyze the demographics and uncover the key statistical factors influencing survival.

🎯 Key Questions Addressed
•	Survival by Class: What was the survival probability for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd class passengers?
•	Gender Bias: What was the difference in survival rates between male and female passengers?
•	Age Profile: Did children and the elderly have different survival chances compared to the general population?
•	Fare vs. Survival: Was there a correlation between the ticket price a passenger paid and their outcome?

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Tool	Purpose
Power BI Desktop	Visualization, Dashboard Creation, and Data Modeling.
Power Query	Data cleaning, transformation, and handling of missing values (e.g., Age).
DAX	Creating explicit measures for key metrics (e.g., Average Survival Rate).
Source Data	titanic_dataset.csv

📊 Dashboard Summary
The final Power BI dashboard provides an interactive view of these findings:
1.	Survival Rate by Class: A clear visualization showing the dramatic difference in survival rates across the three classes.
2.	Age Distribution Analysis: Histograms comparing the age of survivors vs. non-survivors.
3.	Passenger Metrics: KPI cards displaying total passengers, overall survival rate, and counts by embarkation port.
