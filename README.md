🗓️ 30 Days of Data Sets

This repository documents my 30-day data analysis challenge, where I explore a new dataset each day to improve my skills in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

Each folder (Day 1, Day 2, etc.) contains:

The dataset used

SQL queries or Python notebooks for analysis

Notes and observations

Screenshots of results

💡 Goal:
To strengthen my understanding of data manipulation, querying, and storytelling using real-world datasets.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies:

SQL (Azure Data Studio)

Excel / CSV Datasets

Git & GitHub for version control

📅 Day 1 Project:
Earthquake Data (Tsunami Impact Analysis) — A study of earthquake records and their relationships with tsunami occurrences. This analysis includes querying magnitude, depth, yearly trends, and tsunami frequency using SQL.
