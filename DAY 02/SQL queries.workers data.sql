AS SUM_CAPITAL_GAIN 
FROM workers_data
WHERE income_50K=1
GROUP BY income_50K
ORDER BY SUM_CAPITAL_GAIN;

--------- Grouping and Filtering (GROUP BY, HAVING)---------------

SELECT COUNT(*) 
AS NO_OF_WORKERS, education 
FROM workers_data

AS AVERAGE_AGE, gender FROM workers_data
GROUP BY gender;

-- List the top $5$ most common occupation categories, ordered by the count.
SELECT TOP(5) occupation, COUNT(*) AS Common_occupation FROM workers_data
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY COUNT(*);

-- Find all workclass categories that have more than $2,000$ workers.
SELECT workclass, COUNT(*) 
AS num_workers
FROM workers_data
GROUP BY workclass
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2000;

-- For each race, calculate the average hours_per_week worked, but only include groups where the average hours worked is less than $40$.
SELECT race, AVG(hours_per_week) 
AS AVERAGE_WORK_HOURS 
FROM workers_data
GROUP BY race
HAVING AVG(hours_per_week) < 40;


------------- Advanced Queries (LIKE, BETWEEN, CASE/Subqueries)---------

-- Retrieve all records where the occupation column contains the word Sales (e.g., could be 'Sales' or 'Other-Sales').
SELECT * FROM workers_data
WHERE occupation LIKE '%Sales%';

-- for all Female workers who have an income greater than $50K (income_>50K = 1) and work more than 45 hours per week.
SELECT age, occupation, hours_per_week FROM workers_data
WHERE gender='FEMALE'
AND hours_per_week > 45
AND income_50K=1;

-- Identify the native_country with the highest total number of female workers.
SELECT TOP(1) native_country, COUNT(*) AS num_female_workers
FROM workers_data
WHERE gender = 'Female'
GROUP BY native_country
ORDER BY num_female_workers DESC;

-- Categorize workers into three age groups (Young: 17-30, Middle: 31-50, Senior:
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN age BETWEEN 17 AND 30 THEN 'Young: 17-30'
        WHEN age BETWEEN 31 AND 50 THEN 'Middle: 31-50'
        ELSE 'Senior: 51+'
    END AS age,
    COUNT(*) AS num_workers
FROM workers_data
GROUP BY age
ORDER BY num_workers DESC;

SELECT AVG(capital_gain) 
AS average_capital_gain
FROM workers_data
WHERE occupation = 'Prof-specialty' 
AND education = 'Bachelors';
